# Fine-dust-linear-regression-analysis
It is an analysis of fine dust relations between China and Korea using Python.

# why do it?
It is arguable whether air  pollutions from China  actually affect the air quality of Korea.
So, we decided to verify how valid this is.
Indeed, if China 's air quality affects Korean air quality, 
Korea' s future air quality can be predicted based on China 's information.

# Conclusion
1. Most of the data is biased to below 100 PM. (skewed)

2. The reliability of Chinese data is insufficient. Also, China data is not up to date. (2010 to 2015 dataset)

3. A time series analysis method should be introduced to properly verify the claim that fine dust from China affects Korea.

4. We should use industrial city data in eastern China rather than Beijing, China.
